# UnityView4Xamarin.Forms
Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android binding project and abstraction to use it in Xamarin.Forms


<br/>

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to give every Xamarin-Developer the chance to easily use Unity3D in an app. It will be possible to use it as every other Xamarin-stuff. 
Go to nuget, take the package you need (Unity3D for Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS or Xamarin.Forms), add the UnityView to your xaml / code and done.

The Unity3D-Developer may do the things he or she does best. Developing 3D stuff. And then just take the fitting Asset from the Unity Asset Store and the app is good to go - to get integrated with the Xamarin-part.
